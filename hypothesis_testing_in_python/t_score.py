Sure! Let’s break down what you did step by step in a simple way.

### What You’re Trying to Do

You want to compare the weights of two groups of shipments:
- **Group 1**: Shipments that were **on time** (late == "No").
- **Group 2**: Shipments that were **late** (late == "Yes").

You want to see if there is a significant difference in the average weights of these two groups.

### Steps You Followed

1. **Calculate the Sample Means**:
   - You have the average weight for both groups:
     - `xbar_no`: Average weight of on-time shipments.
     - `xbar_yes`: Average weight of late shipments.

2. **Calculate the Sample Standard Deviations**:
   - You have the standard deviations for both groups:
     - `s_no`: How much the weights of on-time shipments vary.
     - `s_yes`: How much the weights of late shipments vary.

3. **Calculate the Sample Sizes**:
   - You have the number of shipments in each group:
     - `n_no`: Number of on-time shipments.
     - `n_yes`: Number of late shipments.

### Calculating the Test Statistic

1. **Numerator**:
   - You calculated the difference between the two sample means:
   ```python
   numerator = xbar_no - xbar_yes
   ```
   - This tells you how much heavier or lighter one group is compared to the other.

2. **Denominator**:
   - You calculated the standard error, which tells you how much the sample means might vary:
   ```python
   denominator = np.sqrt(s_no ** 2 / n_no + s_yes ** 2 / n_yes)
   ```
   - This combines the variability of both groups and adjusts for their sizes.

3. **Test Statistic (t-statistic)**:
   - You calculated the t-statistic using the formula:
   ```python
   t_stat = numerator / denominator
   ```
   - This tells you how many standard errors the difference in means is away from zero. A larger absolute value of the t-statistic suggests a bigger difference between the groups.

4. **Print the Result**:
   - Finally, you printed the t-statistic to see the result:
   ```python
   print(t_stat)
   ```

### Summary

- You compared the average weights of two groups of shipments.
- You calculated how different the averages are (numerator) and how much they might vary (denominator).
- The t-statistic helps you understand if the difference in weights is significant or just due to random chance.

In simple terms, you used a formula to see if the weights of on-time and late shipments are really different from each other!
